        Greetings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Pastor Joshua, called and chosen by God to serve in His vineyard. From a young age, the
        Lord placed in my heart a deep burden for prayer, teaching, and shepherding His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        My vision is to build a Christ-centered community where every believer grows in faith, walks
        in holiness, and becomes a witness of God’s Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is my joy and privilege to serve not as a master but as a servant of Christ, encouraging
        the body of Christ to rise up and fulfill God’s purpose in this generation.
