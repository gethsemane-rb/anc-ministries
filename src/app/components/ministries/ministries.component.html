          <h3>Kids Ministry</h3>
          <p>
            Children’s ministry in the church is dedicated to nurturing the
            faith of young children and laying a strong spiritual foundation in
            their lives. It focuses on teaching the Bible in simple and
            age-appropriate ways, guiding children to pray, worship, and
            experience God’s love personally.
